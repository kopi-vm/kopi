Fix markdown formatting issues.

## Steps to execute:

1. Run `bun format` to format markdown files
2. Run `bun lint` for Remark linting and validation
5. Run `bun lint:external` for Remark linting and validation

Both commands must pass successfully. If any command fails, fix the issues before proceeding to the next command.
