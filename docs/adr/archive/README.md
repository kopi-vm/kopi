# ADR Archive

This directory contains historical Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that were created before the adoption of the standardized naming convention.

## Purpose

These ADRs are preserved here to:
- Maintain historical documentation and decision context
- Preserve git history and traceability
- Keep the main ADR directory clean for new documents

## Original Naming Convention

The archived ADRs use the original naming format:
- `###-<descriptive-title>.md` (3-digit number + title)

## New ADR Location

New ADRs should be created in the main `docs/adr/` directory using the new naming convention:
- `ADR-####-<descriptive-title>.md` (ADR prefix + 4-digit number + title)

## Accessing Archived ADRs

These documents remain fully accessible and can be referenced in documentation. When linking to archived ADRs, use the full path:
- `docs/adr/archive/001-kopi-command-structure.md`

## Migration Date

These ADRs were moved to the archive on 2025-09-02 as part of the documentation standardization initiative.
