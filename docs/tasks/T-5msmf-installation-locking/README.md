## Summary

Wire the locking foundation and timeout controls into the installation pipeline so concurrent installers targeting the same JDK coordinate serialize safely without regressing performance for independent installs.

## Scope

- In scope: Canonicalise coordinates, acquire/release locks around installation phases, integrate timeout and feedback hooks, and ensure crash-safe cleanup.
- Out of scope: Uninstallation and cache operations, UI copy changes beyond shared observers, unrelated installation refactors.

## Success Metrics

- Exclusive coordination: contention tests confirm no two installations of the same coordinate proceed concurrently.
- Parallel installs: distinct coordinates maintain baseline throughput with <5% regression from pre-locking benchmarks.
- Crash recovery: forced termination during install leaves no stale locks or partial directories.
