## Summary

Wire the locking foundation and timeout controls into the installation pipeline so concurrent installers targeting the same JDK coordinate serialize safely without regressing performance for independent installs.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Canonicalise installation coordinates and wrap install phases with locks.
  - Integrate timeout and feedback hooks for contention scenarios.
  - Ensure crash-safe cleanup for partial installs.
- Out of scope:
  - Uninstallation and cache operations.
  - UI copy changes beyond shared observers.
  - Installation refactors unrelated to locking.

## Success Metrics

- Exclusive coordination: Contention tests confirm no two installations of the same coordinate proceed concurrently.
- Parallel throughput: Distinct coordinates maintain baseline install throughput with <5% regression from pre-lock benchmarks.
- Crash recovery: Forced termination leaves no stale locks or partial directories in post-run inspections.
