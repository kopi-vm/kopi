## Summary

Wire the locking foundation and timeout controls into the installation pipeline so concurrent installers targeting the same JDK coordinate serialize safely without regressing performance for independent installs.

## Scope

- In scope: Derive lock keys from canonicalized coordinates, acquire/release locks around installation phases, integrate timeout and feedback hooks, and ensure crash-safe cleanup.
- Out of scope: Uninstallation and cache operations; CLI/UI messaging beyond invoking shared observers; rewriting installation steps unrelated to concurrency.

## Success Metrics

- `Exclusive coordination`: Integration tests confirm no two installations of the same coordinate can proceed concurrently under stress workloads.
- `Parallel installs`: Installations for different coordinates achieve baseline throughput with <5% regression compared to pre-locking benchmarks.
- `Crash recovery`: Forced termination during install leaves the system in a recoverable state with no stale locks or partial directories.

## Detailed Plan

- Identify all installation entry points and wrap them with lock acquisition using the foundation APIs, ensuring locks cover filesystem mutations and metadata updates.
- Normalize coordinate canonicalization (vendor, version, OS, architecture) prior to lock key generation and validate via unit tests.
- Thread timeout and feedback observers from T-lqyk8 through the installation command stack, mapping errors to user-friendly exit codes.
- Extend installation tests to cover contention scenarios, crash recovery simulations, and parallel installs on distinct coordinates.
- Update developer documentation describing installation locking behavior, default timeouts, and diagnostic logging expectations.

## Notes

- Coordinate with packaging scripts to ensure they respect new locking behavior when invoked non-interactively.
- Consider adding feature flags to allow phased rollout or emergency disable if regressions occur.
