## Summary

Serialise cache mutations via exclusive writer locks while preserving lock-free reads, ensuring metadata consistency across concurrent refreshes and aligning with shared timeout behaviour.

## Scope

- In scope: Implement writer lock coordination for cache refresh operations, atomic temp-file swap, timeout-aware retries, and telemetry hooks for contention observability.
- Out of scope: Installation and uninstallation locking, cache schema redesign, external metadata fetch changes.

## Success Metrics

- Single writer: stress tests verify only one cache refresh runs at a time while additional writers block or time out per configuration.
- Reader safety: concurrent reader tests confirm cache consumers never observe partially written data across 100 iterative refresh cycles.
- Atomic swap: integrity checks ensure temp-to-final renames leave no stale temporary files after forced termination scenarios.
