## Summary

Serialise cache mutations via exclusive writer locks while preserving lock-free reads, ensuring metadata consistency across concurrent refreshes and aligning with shared timeout behaviour.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Implement writer lock coordination for cache refresh operations.
  - Deliver atomic temp-file swaps and timeout-aware retries.
  - Add telemetry hooks for contention observability.
- Out of scope:
  - Installation and uninstallation locking.
  - Cache schema redesign.
  - External metadata fetch changes.

## Success Metrics

- Single writer: Stress tests verify only one cache refresh runs at a time while additional writers block or time out per configuration.
- Reader safety: Concurrent reader tests confirm cache consumers never observe partially written data across 100 iterative refresh cycles.
- Atomic swap: Integrity checks ensure temp-to-final renames leave no stale temporary files after forced termination scenarios.
