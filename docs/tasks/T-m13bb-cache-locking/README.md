## Summary

Serialize cache mutations via exclusive writer locks while preserving lock-free reads, ensuring metadata consistency across concurrent refreshes and aligning with shared timeout behavior.

## Scope

- In scope: Implement writer lock coordination for cache refresh operations, atomic temp-file swap, timeout-aware retries, and telemetry hooks for contention observability.
- Out of scope: Installation and uninstallation locking; redesign of cache schema or external metadata fetching.

## Success Metrics

- `Single writer`: Stress tests verify only one cache refresh runs at a time while additional writers block or time out per configuration.
- `Reader safety`: Concurrent reader tests confirm cache consumers never observe partially written data across 100 iterative refresh cycles.
- `Atomic swap`: File integrity checks show temp-to-final rename guarantees with no stale temporary files after forced termination scenarios.

## Detailed Plan

- Introduce a cache-specific lock wrapper using the shared locking foundation with a dedicated `cache.lock` file and timeout configuration defaults.
- Refactor cache refresh workflow to write into temporary files, fsync, and atomically replace the final artifact, with cleanup for dangling temp files.
- Integrate timeout/cancellation observers so cache operations emit consistent feedback and logs during contention.
- Build integration tests simulating concurrent refreshers and readers, including crash recovery and degraded filesystem scenarios.
- Update internal documentation describing cache locking strategy, fallback behavior, and monitoring expectations.

## Notes

- Evaluate the need for checksum validation or version tagging to detect partially refreshed cache entries during recovery.
- Coordinate with analytics/telemetry to capture lock contention metrics for capacity planning.
