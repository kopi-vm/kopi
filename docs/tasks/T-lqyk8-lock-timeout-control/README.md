## Summary

Deliver configurable lock acquisition timeouts, graceful cancellation, and shared instrumentation hooks that power user feedback during contention while meeting precision and performance targets.

## Scope

- In scope: Implement timeout configuration precedence, polling backoff, cancellation handling, and shared telemetry APIs for wait state reporting; integrate with the locking foundation from T-ec5ew.
- Out of scope: Operation-specific wiring of timeouts, user-facing message formatting beyond reusable hooks, filesystem fallback logic already covered elsewhere.

## Success Metrics

- Timeout accuracy within ±1 second across 99% of runs for representative durations (0, 30, 60, 600 seconds).
- CPU overhead below 0.1% single-core utilisation during 5-minute wait simulations.
- Cancellation pathway produces deterministic exit codes and zero leaked resources across 100 forced interrupt tests.
