## Summary

Deliver configurable lock acquisition timeouts, graceful cancellation, and shared instrumentation hooks that power user feedback during contention while meeting precision and performance targets.

## Scope

- In scope: Implement timeout configuration precedence, polling backoff, cancellation handling, and shared telemetry APIs for wait state reporting; integrate with lock abstraction from T-ec5ew.
- Out of scope: Operation-specific wiring of timeouts; user-facing message formatting beyond reusable hooks; filesystem fallback logic already covered by T-ec5ew.

## Success Metrics

- `Timeout accuracy`: Automated timing tests confirm ±1 second accuracy across 99% of runs for representative durations (0, 30, 60, 600 seconds).
- `CPU overhead`: Profiling shows <0.1% single-core utilization during wait loops over 5-minute simulations.
- `Cancellation path`: Ctrl-C handling results in deterministic cancellation logs and exit codes with zero leaked resources in 100 forced interrupt tests.

## Detailed Plan

- Implement configuration resolution pipeline honoring CLI flag, environment variable, config file, and defaults; expose effective values to diagnostics.
- Build timeout-aware acquisition wrapper around the locking foundation, including exponential backoff scheduling and cancellation hooks.
- Provide a shared observer interface used by UI layers to publish elapsed/remaining time, resource names, and actionable guidance.
- Add unit and integration tests covering timeout range validation, infinite waits, immediate failures, and cancellation signals across supported platforms.
- Document timeout usage and extension points for downstream tasks, including guidelines for consistent error messaging.

## Notes

- Coordinate with T-60h68 to ensure observer interfaces supply all fields required for user-facing messages.
- Ensure telemetry hooks are optional so headless environments can disable them without affecting timeout enforcement.
