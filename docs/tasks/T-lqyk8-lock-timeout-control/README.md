## Summary

Deliver configurable lock acquisition timeouts, graceful cancellation, and shared instrumentation hooks that power user feedback during contention while meeting precision and performance targets.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Implement timeout configuration precedence and polling backoff.
  - Handle cancellation pathways and shared telemetry APIs for wait-state reporting.
  - Integrate with the locking foundation delivered in T-ec5ew.
- Out of scope:
  - Operation-specific wiring of timeouts.
  - User-facing message formatting beyond reusable hooks.
  - Filesystem fallback logic covered in other tasks.

## Success Metrics

- Timeout accuracy: Maintain Â±1 second accuracy across 99% of runs for representative durations (0, 30, 60, 600 seconds).
- CPU overhead: Keep lock wait polling below 0.1% single-core utilisation during 5-minute simulations.
- Cancellation robustness: Produce deterministic exit codes and zero leaked resources across 100 forced interrupt tests.
