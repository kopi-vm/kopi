## Summary

Retire the `fs2` crate by migrating disk space checks to `sysinfo` and file-in-use detection to standard library locks, eliminating the dependency while preserving user-facing diagnostics and aligning with ADR-8mnaz.

## Scope

- In scope: Replace `fs2` usage across disk checks and locking helpers, remove the dependency from manifests, update documentation, and validate cross-platform behaviour.
- Out of scope: Broader refactors unrelated to disk space or locking, removal of `sysinfo`, or changes to external tooling.

## Success Metrics

- `fs2` removed: manifests and code contain no references to the crate.
- Functional parity: disk space reporting and file-in-use detection match historical behaviour on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Traceability: requirements FR-x63pa and FR-rxelv marked complete with supporting tests and documentation.
