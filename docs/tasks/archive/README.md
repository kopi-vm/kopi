# Tasks Archive

This directory contains historical task documentation that was created before the adoption of the standardized naming convention.

## Purpose

These task directories are preserved here to:
- Maintain historical task documentation and implementation details
- Preserve git history and traceability
- Keep the main tasks directory clean for new documents

## Original Structure

The archived tasks use the original naming format:
- Simple descriptive directory names (e.g., `install/`, `shims/`, `metadata/`)
- Each containing their own `design.md` and/or `plan.md` files

## New Task Location

New tasks should be created in the main `docs/tasks/` directory using the new naming convention:
- `T-####-<descriptive-name>/` (T prefix + 4-digit number + name)
- Each containing `design.md` and `plan.md` files (lowercase, no numbering)

## Accessing Archived Tasks
